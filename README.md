> Card lookup and deck building project focused on Pokemon TCG Pocket

## About

Pok√©mon TCG Pocket Util is a Rails 8 utility where users can easily create and share decks using the current cardpool for the Pok√©mon TCG Pocket mobile game. The deck-sharing feature is inspired by the Legends of Runeterra deck-sharing feature that encoded all the cards needed for a deck into a code.


## Description

Pok√©mon TCG Pocket Util API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The frontend uses Hotwire and Turbo to provide an user-friendly way to interact with the application. The purpose of this project is to explore the features of the base Rails 8 suite, and solve a small pain-point of mine when comparing the player experience in LoR vs the current iteration of Pok√©mon TCGP.
